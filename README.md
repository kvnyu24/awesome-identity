# Awesome Identity [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re) 

This is a curated list of academic, engineering, and educational resources related to ***identity***, ***privacy***, and ***reputation***. It's audience includes researchers, developers, *enterprises*, investors, students, and anyone who's interested in these topics.

The highly *interoperable*, *composable*, and *user-owned* future of the Internet, around which "web3" is termed, is far away from maturity, despite large amounts of capital being poured into the space. In the meantime, *identity*, aside from blockchain tech, is emerging as a crucial new primitive that may eventually unlock the massive adoption of web3 applications (or as Jack Dorsey would like to term it, [web5](https://twitter.com/jack/status/1535314738078486533)). Since identities are centered around user behaviors, their *privacy* naturally becomes important. Similarly, a wide array of identity-based applications are built around user *reputation*, which measures and (sometimes) quantifies vanilla user behavior data. 

With the above in mind, this repo keeps track of the latest academic research, project and framework development, and educational resources related to the field. We attempt to keep all the resources as approachable as possible by providing more context about them. For academic papers, it's recommended for additional explanatory resources like slides and videos to be added.
